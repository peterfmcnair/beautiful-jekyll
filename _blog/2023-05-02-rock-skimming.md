# Rock Skimming
"Isn't it sad that all the best skimming rocks have probably already been skimmed".

This has stuck with me and I don't know why. Maybe it's the mellow finality, or maybe it's the sharp biting reality.

There have always been those before us.

Sometimes simple things take us much further than they have any right to.
