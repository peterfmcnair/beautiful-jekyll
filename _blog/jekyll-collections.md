# How I got around the naming convention for Jekyll Posts
It's annoying to have to write the date in the file name for jekyll posts since I want to have the same experience in my obsidian browser as my website does.

That means if I link to another page like [Stay at the Helm if Overwhelmed](Stay%20at%20the%20Helm%20if%20Overwhelmed.md) or [Rock Skimming](rock-skimming) I can make it work in both scenarios.
