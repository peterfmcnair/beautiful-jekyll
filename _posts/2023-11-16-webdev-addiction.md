# My Strange Addiction
I have to admit - I get addicted to webdev.
I don't think I could pursue it as a career because I would find it very challenging to set boundaries.

I delayed dinner, put off relaxation for the night, all for what? For a website that only I actually use and care about?

I'm not even getting paid for it!

Ironically I might feel less motivation to stay at it if I was getting paid for it - who knows.

# Where did this come from?
This stems from my explorations of [jekyll collections](2023-11-16-jekyll-collections).
