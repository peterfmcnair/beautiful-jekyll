# The dreaded "I'll foot the bill"
It's always the worst to foot a shared bill. You have to find the money from somewhere (since it might be more than you've got to spend for the week), but it is only as a short term loan before your friends pay you back.

It's much better to pay for big things from a bank account that has plenty of buffer room (for instance the one that pays rent) so it can absorb it. What sucks is that you are less cognizant of the small ins and outs in an account like that so it can be hard to follow up on.
