# Vocational tinting
I have often wondered to what degree our jobs or vocations colour how we view the world.
As an engineer, I find myself dissecting everyday items for the mechanisms that constitute it; I need to know *how*.
I also find myself saying I'll "debug" problems in my life. 

This isn't unique to me. I've heard doctors say they're "immune" to something when they have grown accustomed to it.
