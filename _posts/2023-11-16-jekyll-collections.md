# How I got around the naming convention for Jekyll Posts
It's annoying to have to write the date in the file name for jekyll posts since I want to have the same experience in my obsidian browser as my website does.

That means if I link to another page like [Webdev Addiction](2023-11-16-webdev-addiction) I can make it work in both scenarios.
