# Sunswift
I'm currently the Embedded Systems lead at [Sunswift Racing](https://sunswift.com).
In October we will be competing in the [Bridgestone World Solar Challenge](https://worldsolarchallenge.org/), a 3000km journey from Darwin to Adelaide.
# University
I'm nearing the end of my degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/study/undergraduate/bachelor-of-engineering-honours-electrical) at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). It's been a crazy ride and I'm stoked to be almost there.
# Writing
Having established my website and becoming proficient in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (which I absolutely adore and cannot recommend enough), I've put much more focus on my writing for others.
I've kept a diary since 2016, however now I'm taking it one step further and sharing my writing with others.
# Travel
The travel bug inside of me is awakening as I watch alot of friends overseas and interstate.
I'd like to travel after finishing uni next year and am currently thinking of backpacking and cycling across Europe.
